# Syncing my AI workspaces

A **synced workspace** is a shared local folder that acts as a **bridge between LM Studio and ChatGPT**, where you keep **all your working artifacts** — specs, roadmaps, drafts, architecture diagrams — in a versioned, structured way. It gives you:

* 🗂️ A **single source of truth** for planning and documentation
* 🔄 Easy copy/paste or file sharing between tools
* ✅ Context persistence without relying on memory in either LM Studio or ChatGPT
* 📦 Optional Git versioning (if you want a history of your thinking and decisions)

## 🧱 Structure of a Synced Workspace

Here’s a minimal file structure you can use:

```markdown
/workspace
├── roadmap/
│   ├── 2025_Q3_roadmap_draft.md
│   ├── milestone_notes.md
├── specs/
│   ├── budgeting_tool_spec_v1.md
│   ├── transaction_importer_spec_v1.md
├── feedback/
│   ├── spec_review_by_chatgpt.md
│   ├── roadmap_refinements.md
├── models/
│   ├── prompt_templates.md
│   ├── model_notes_deepseek.md
└── archive/
    ├── 2025_07_backup.zip
```

You can locate this wherever you want — e.g., `~/dev/planning-workspace/`.

## 🧠 How It Works in Your Workflow

### 🔸 In LM Studio

* Paste a prompt and generate a roadmap or spec
* Save output to `specs/` or `roadmap/` as a `.md` file

### 🔸 In ChatGPT

* Upload or paste the file
* Ask me to evaluate, score, or refactor
* Save the reviewed/refined version in `feedback/`

### 🔸 Repeat

* Paste reviewed version back into LM Studio if you want to regenerate
* Archive earlier versions for traceability

| **Manual memory**       | Makes up for LM Studio’s lack of memory                          |
| **Context persistence** | You can re-load past decisions into ChatGPT                      |
| **Version-safe**        | Easily zip or Git commit versions of your planning               |
| **AI-neutral**          | You can use Claude, LM Studio, ChatGPT all on the same artifacts |
