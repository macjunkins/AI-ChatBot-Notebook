## 🔧 Role-Based Separation Strategy

You’ve committed to **separating concerns** between:

| Role                                  | Tooling                               | Notes                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product & Business Management**     | ChatGPT (online)                      | For strategy, roadmaps, feedback, iteration             |
| **Planning & Documentation Drafting** | LM Studio + local LLM                 | For spec generation, roadmaps, module planning, offline |
| **Software Development / Coding**     | VS Code + local LLM (e.g., Continue)  | For code writing, refactoring, debugging                |
| **Version Control**                   | GitHub CLI                            | Minimal overhead; GitKraken/Tower were ruled out        |
| **Issue Tracking**                    | Linear (CLI or GUI)                   | Used to track roadmap implementation                    |
| **Diagramming**                       | Mermaid (in VS Code) or Freeform/Miro | For rendering architecture or workflows                 |

## 🧱 Synced Workspace Structure

You’re setting up a shared folder to bridge LM Studio, ChatGPT, and future tools:

```
/workspace
├── roadmap/
│   ├── 2025_Q3_roadmap_draft.md
│   ├── milestone_notes.md
├── specs/
│   ├── budgeting_tool_spec_v1.md
│   ├── transaction_importer_spec_v1.md
├── feedback/
│   ├── spec_review_by_chatgpt.md
│   ├── roadmap_refinements.md
├── models/
│   ├── prompt_templates.md
│   ├── model_notes_deepseek.md
├── notes/
│   ├── curated_summaries.md
│   ├── questions_to_follow_up.md
└── archive/
    ├── 2025_07_backup.zip
```

> Purpose: acts as a persistent manual memory across LM Studio (offline), ChatGPT (online), and any dev tools. You’ll manage versions manually or via Git.

---

## 📝 Prompt Templates for LM Studio

You will use LM Studio with local models to generate ad hoc documents like:

1. **Technical Specs** (modules, APIs, assumptions)
2. **Product Roadmaps** (milestones by quarter)
3. **Architecture Breakdowns** (components and responsibilities)

> Example prompts are saved in `/models/prompt_templates.md`.

---

## 💻 Dev Workspace Setup (Planned)

You’ll eventually set up a **local-first coding assistant inside VS Code**.

### Planned Stack:

| Component    | Tool                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| IDE          | VS Code                                     |
| AI Assistant | Continue (VS Code extension)                |
| LLM Backend  | LM Studio or Ollama                         |
| Model        | Codestral, DeepSeek Coder, StarCoder2 (TBD) |
| Git          | GitHub CLI                                  |

### Rationale:

* Avoids Copilot subscription
* Keeps code local and private
* Gives full control over model, context, and config
* Maintains separation from product tools

> Setup pending; assistance will be requested later.

## 💬 Tool Evaluations (Past Notes)

### Rejected / Avoided:

| Tool                 | Reason                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitKraken            | Too team-oriented, heavier than needed                                        |
| Copilot              | Costs money, sends code to OpenAI, unnecessary given local options            |
| Claude               | Not ideal for product management vs ChatGPT's memory + planning flow          |
| LM Studio for Coding | Good for chat generation, but not integrated with IDE well enough for dev use |
| AnythingLLM          | Useful for RAG/chat, but not needed for your current use case                 |

---

## 🧠 Workflow Philosophy

Your workflow is optimized around:

* **Separation of concerns** (no tool overlap)
* **Privacy and cost control**
* **Manual memory via files** instead of relying on persistent memory
* **Tool stability** over hype cycles
* **AI as a collaborator**, not a black box

## ✅ Current State Summary

| Area                     | Status                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Product Planning         | ✅ Locked in (ChatGPT)             |
| Roadmap Strategy         | ✅ Built in past chats             |
| Workspace Design         | ✅ Specified and ready             |
| LM Studio Use            | ✅ Starting to generate artifacts  |
| VS Code Dev Stack        | 🔜 To be set up soon              |
| Git + Linear Integration | ✅ CLI ready, minimal setup needed |
| Diagramming              | ✅ Mermaid in VS Code or Freeform  |

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Create your synced workspace folder** as above.
2. 📝 **Start generating**:

   * Roadmap drafts
   * Module specs
   * Prompt templates
3. 🔄 **Bring drafts back to ChatGPT** for:

   * Scoring against the roadmap
   * Strategic feedback and refinement
4. 💻 **When ready, set up VS Code + Continue + local model** with my help.
5. 📦 Optionally use Git to version your workspace (especially for specs and feedback files).
6. 📁 Archive older planning iterations for traceability.
