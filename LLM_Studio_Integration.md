# 🔎 LM Studio — Quick Review

* **Pros**:

  * Easy to run local models (GGUF/GGML).
  * Simple UI for model inference.
  * Offline and private.

* **Cons**:

  * No real “workspace” or project management.
  * Context window limited by the model (typically 4K–8K, some 16K with Q5\_1+).
  * No multi-turn memory beyond the session.
  * No plugin system or coding environment.

You’re **not wrong** — it's great for short tasks or privacy-focused queries, but it's not designed for *developer workflows or persistent sessions.*

### 🧠 Better Alternatives (Depending on Your Use Case)

#### 1. **OpenDevin** (Dev-focused agent framework)

* **Goal:** Full AI developer agent experience, workspace/project-based.
* **Features:**

  * Workspace-based memory.
  * Code writing, execution, and context-aware reasoning.
  * Uses local or remote models (can plug into LM Studio backend).
* **Status:** Active but still early. You might need Docker and some tinkering.

#### 2. **ChatDev / Devika / GPT-Engineer**

* **Goal:** Agentic codebases, can persist files, iterate on projects.
* **Features:**

  * Project structure awareness.
  * File-based memory (edits files in-place).
  * Some allow multi-model configuration.
* **Best For:** AI-assisted programming over a long session/project.

#### 3. **Ollama + AnythingLLM**

* **Goal:** Simple local LLM infra with “workspace” flexibility.
* **AnythingLLM** adds:

  * File/document ingestion.
  * Basic workspace memory.
  * Frontend UI and chat memory.
* Can use **Ollama**, **LM Studio**, or **local APIs** for LLMs.
* More flexible than LM Studio alone.

#### 4. **Open Interpreter**

* **Goal:** LLM agent with real terminal access and file control.
* More “agent” than “chatbot.”
* It **does** retain workspace-level awareness (via file system).
* Still needs model backend (like LM Studio or Ollama).

#### 5. **KoboldCpp / SillyTavern / LocalAI (for power users)**

* Great if you're into:

  * Long context roleplay / memory.
  * High customization.
  * UI and proxy layers.

But these are heavier lifts and not workspace- or dev-centric.

### ✅ Recommendation: For Developer Workflow with Project Memory

| Stack                        | Setup Complexity | Notes                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ollama + AnythingLLM**     | Medium           | Add workspaces, docs, file support. Easy UI.             |
| **OpenDevin or Devika**      | High             | Full AI agent, but more fiddly. Ideal for long sessions. |
| **LM Studio + GPT-Engineer** | Low–Medium       | LM for backend, GPT-Eng for project memory.              |

If you want:

* **Easy UX with some memory** → Try **AnythingLLM** with **Ollama**.
* **Agent to help you code over time** → Try **OpenDevin** or **Devika**.
* **Customizable dev workflows** → GPT-Engineer with LM Studio backend.

## LLM Models to consider

---

## ✅ **Best Model for Your Use Case**

### 🔹 **Nous Hermes 2 Mistral 7B (Q6\_K or Q8\_0 quant)**

* **Model name:** `nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b.Q6_K.gguf` or `Q8_0` if you want maximum performance.
* **Why it fits:**

  * Fine-tuned for instruction-following and reasoning.
  * Excellent at structured document generation (e.g., specs, architecture docs, roadmaps).
  * Outperforms most other 7B models in useful output quality.
  * Fast and lightweight enough for your Mac’s 24GB RAM, especially with Q6\_K.
  * Mistral-based (not LLaMA), so it's fast and sharp in reasoning tasks like architecture decisions and outlining milestones.

---

## 🔸 **Alternative Options to Consider**

### 1. **OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B**

* Great instruction-following, more concise than Nous Hermes.
* Slightly lighter; excellent for summarizing and reviewing documents (like alignment reviews with me).

### 2. **MythoMax L2 13B (Q4\_K\_M or Q5\_K\_M)**

* More creative and detailed, useful if you’re writing very narrative-heavy user stories or product pitches.
* 13B is larger—will run on your Mac, but use Q4 or Q5 to avoid memory pressure.

### 3. **Deepseek Coder 6.7B (if you want code-focused completions locally)**

* Excellent at writing specs, commenting code, and pseudocode-level planning.
* You don’t *need* this if LM Studio is just for planning and doc drafting, but good to have on standby.

---

## 🧠 How to Choose Quantization

For your 24GB RAM:

* Use **Q6\_K** if you want great quality and speed.
* Use **Q8\_0** if you want max quality and don’t mind slightly slower response or increased memory use.
* Avoid Q4 for reasoning-heavy tasks like architecture docs—it's faster but loses too much nuance.

---

## 📦 Where to Get the Models

Use **LM Studio’s model browser** or get them from:

* [TheBloke’s Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) – known for stable and well-tested GGUF models.

---

## 🔁 Sample Setup Flow

1. Open LM Studio → Browse models.
2. Search **"Nous Hermes 2 Mistral"** → Select `Q6_K` quant.
3. After download, enable system prompts if desired.
4. Use chat templates like:

   > "You are an AI technical writing assistant. Your job is to help me draft product architecture documents and dev roadmaps. Output should be formatted in markdown with headers."

Let me know when you've got your first model downloaded, and I can help you write your prompt templates and system instructions for it. We can even pair LM Studio + ChatGPT to draft + review in sync.
