# üß© Separation of Concerns Strategy (for Paid ChatGPT Use)

Here‚Äôs a clean strategy to separate your work into **distinct ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù or domains**, using:

* **Projects** (long-term memory & context)
* **Individual chats** (for focused sessions)
* **File attachments & summaries** (for handoffs, checklists, logs)

---

### üß± 1. **Top-Level Concern Areas**

Use 4‚Äì6 **primary areas**, each mapped to a project or a clearly tagged session:

| Concern Area                  | Description                                                          | Format                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| üñ• **Software Dev**           | App architecture, dev workflows, code structure, toolchains          | Project: `Finance App (Rust + Tauri)`                 |
| üß† **Product & Business**     | Roadmaps, pricing, user needs, MVP planning                          | Project: `Product Strategy`                           |
| üèãÔ∏è **Fitness & Wellness**    | Gym plans, nutrition, recovery, tracking results                     | Chat: ‚ÄúGym & Nutrition Plan‚Äù                          |
| üè† **Household Ops**          | Meal planning, shopping, health tracking, weekly rhythm              | Chat: ‚ÄúHousehold Management‚Äù                          |
| üíº **Collaboration Projects** | Any external open source or contributor work (e.g. Electron flasher) | Chat: ‚ÄúElectron USB Flasher Cleanup‚Äù or project-based |
| üî¨ **Experimental / R\&D**    | Language tests, tool evaluation, workflows                           | Chat: ‚ÄúTech Sandbox‚Äù                                  |

---

### üß† 2. **Projects Strategy**

Paid users can use **Projects** to persist memory by topic. I suggest:

* **Project 1: "Finance App (Rust + Tauri)"**

  * Memory includes: dev goals, app features, toolchain choices
  * Use sub-chats for:

    * Feature spec writing
    * Code refactors
    * Rust/Tauri learning sessions

* **Project 2: "Product Strategy"**

  * For business-side planning, GTM, monetization
  * Connect to dev project, but keep financially focused

* Optional:

  * **Project 3: "Fitness & Wellness"** for tracking training blocks over time
  * **Project 4: "Household Ops"** for budgeting, groceries, schedules, and evolving plans

---

### üßæ 3. **Naming & Tagging Conventions**

Use prefixes or emojis to visually organize your chats:

| Prefix     | Meaning                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `üíª DEV:`  | Software engineering, code, architecture |
| `üß≠ PLAN:` | Strategy, roadmapping, research          |
| `üìã TODO:` | Action plans, task lists                 |
| `üìÇ LOG:`  | Weekly log, journal, or fitness progress |
| `üß™ TEST:` | Scratchpad, prototyping, experimentation |

Examples:

* `üíª DEV: Setup Rust Project for USB`
* `üß≠ PLAN: MVP Timeline for Finance App`
* `üìã TODO: Gym Week 3`

---

### üì¶ 4. **Best Practices for Working in This Setup**

| Habit                                             | Why                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use bookmarks for persistent chats**            | Paid users can pin key threads (like training logs, dev strategy)                  |
| **Use chat titles intentionally**                 | It makes history searchable and reusable                                           |
| **Upload files with version tags**                | e.g. `flasher-v1-index.html`                                                       |
| **Summarize at the end of long sessions**         | Ask me: *‚ÄúSummarize this chat as a weekly report‚Äù* or *‚ÄúExtract all action items‚Äù* |
| **Periodically migrate long chats into Projects** | To persist memory or switch contexts cleanly                                       |

## üóÇ Want a Kickstart?

Perfect. Here‚Äôs your full setup: templates, memory primer, and a mapping of your recent work into clearly separated domains. You‚Äôre now ready to make full use of Projects, memory, and structured workflows.

---

# ‚úÖ 1. **Starter Message Templates (Per Domain)**

### üíª **Software Dev ‚Äì Rust + Tauri Finance App**

```
I'm building a personal finance desktop app using Rust and Tauri.
I‚Äôm new to Rust but comfortable with product planning. Help me plan features, guide my Rust learning, and structure the app modularly.
Today's goal: [e.g., set up initial file structure / clarify command module boundaries / add CSV import]
```

### üß≠ **Product & Business Strategy**

```
I'm managing this app like a solo business. Help me balance development with revenue planning, pricing, user personas, and market fit.
Today's focus: [e.g., defining MVP scope / mapping pricing tiers / choosing feature priorities]
```

### üèãÔ∏è **Fitness & Wellness**

```
I train daily with my 23-year-old daughter. I'm rebuilding strength and losing abdominal fat. She's underweight and new to fitness.
We use an A/B training split with weekends for cardio and recovery. Match our workouts by target muscle group with difficulty scaling.
Today's goal: [e.g., week 3 plan / back pain adaptation / meal prep to support recovery]
```

### üè† **Household Management**

```
I manage a household of 6 with diverse dietary and health needs.
We shop weekly (Costco ‚Üí Aldi ‚Üí Walmart) and plan around budget and health constraints.
Help me build flexible grocery lists, meal plans, and routines that reduce my workload.
Focus: [e.g., breakfast planning / food rotation strategy / budget prediction]
```

### ü§ù **Collaboration Projects (e.g., Electron USB Flasher)**

```
I‚Äôm contributing to an Electron USB flasher written by a friend under MIT license.
He‚Äôs not experienced with Electron either. I want to professionalize the project before possibly migrating it to Tauri + Rust.
Today I want to: [e.g., refactor file structure / add secure IPC / roadmap a 6-week improvement plan]
```

### üî¨ **R\&D / Sandbox**

```
I‚Äôm exploring tools, workflows, and experiments. Evaluate or test [e.g., LM Studio, JetBrains Juni, Zed, Cline, file system agents].
Keep this space freeform and iterative. No final decisions‚Äîjust structured evaluation.
```

# üß† 2. **Memory Primer: Finance App in Rust + Tauri**

> Use this to seed your Project memory once you upgrade:

**Title:** Personal Finance App (Rust + Tauri)

**Context to store:**

* User is building a personal finance desktop app starting August 1, 2025.
* App will be written in **Rust using the Tauri framework**, and is meant to be lightweight, native, and privacy-focused.
* User has **no prior experience in Rust** and is actively learning. They have infantry-level fitness discipline and are managing time carefully.
* Goal is to ship a **revenue-generating MVP**, not a unicorn. Design choices prioritize maintainability, modularity, and simplicity.
* They separate product planning (with LM Studio or local tools) from development, using ChatGPT for integration, refinement, and direction.
* User may bring in CSV import, transaction tagging, budget categories, and cross-device backup features later.
* Dev tools under consideration: RustRover, WebStorm, GitHub CLI, Zed, and JetBrains Juni.
